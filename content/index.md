summary: Field notes from delegating real work to Factory Droid — what I did, what it did, and every nit in between.

<p class="hero__lede">Where the Factory AI experience gets charted: what I delegated, what actually shipped, and the nits picked out of the fur along the way. The human writes the verdicts. The droids do most of the typing. The pipeline keeps the receipts.</p>

## Buckets

- [[log/index]]
  The running feed: session debriefs, news takes, nits noticed
  mid-delegation. Newest first.
- [[builds/index]]
  Things built with Factory end-to-end, with receipts.
- [[nits/index]]
  The friction ledger. Every nit with a repro, none without.
- [[reviews/index]]
  Factory surfaces reviewed after real usage. What broke, what stuck.
- [[projects/index]]
  The empire: hub pages for the projects built and worked on,
  grouped by family, with receipts.

## How filing works

Everything lands in [[log/index]] first as a draft. If it deserves its
own page it gets promoted into the right bucket and cross-linked back.
Agents do the triage; rules live in AGENTS.md at the repo root.
Publishing is the owner's call. The first entry on the log is this
site's own birth certificate — a droid session, start to finish.
